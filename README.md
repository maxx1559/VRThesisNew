# VRThesisNew
Based on the repository https://github.com/janba/VR-modelling-system which use the GEL library. Biggest new features are hand tracking support, as well as passthrough

If there are problems, try the repository https://github.com/maxx1559/VRThesis, which uses an older version of Unity.
